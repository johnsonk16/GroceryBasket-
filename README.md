# Grocery Basket
## Description
### What?

A web-based application that curates a grocery list based on the recipes you want to make.

### Why?

Many people do not have time to build a shopping list and go grocery shopping. This lack of time pushes people to buy fattening frozen meals or spend even more hard-earned money on takeout meals. 

With Grocery Basket, a tool that builds shopping list for users, people can have more freedom, alleviating the symptoms of being a bad planner. A tool like this would improve the users lives by cutting down on food waste and promoting healthier eating. 

### How?

A previously built mobile application in Android Studio will be our inspiration.  We want to develop a web application that curates a shopping list based off their meals. This application will give the user the freedom to favorite meals and add their own meals. This application will help solve the problem of grocery and meal planning, as well as time planning.

## Getting Started

Before downloading all the files from GroceryBasket-Web, follow the steps below to view the website locally.

### Install
In order to host the website locally, you will need to download XAMPP. Please select the link below that matches your machine and it will automatically download the latet verison of XAMPP (updated on 8/1/19).

**Windows** | [Windows Download](https://www.apachefriends.org/xampp-files/7.3.7/xampp-windows-x64-7.3.7-1-VC15-installer.exe)

**OS X** | [OS X Download](https://www.apachefriends.org/xampp-files/7.3.7/xampp-osx-7.3.7-1-vm.dmg)

**Linux** | [Linux Download](https://www.apachefriends.org/xampp-files/7.3.7/xampp-linux-x64-7.3.7-1-installer.run)  
   
**Don't have a text editor?**
If you do not have a text editor and would like to view our code on something other than Github, below are two that we recommend!


[Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
This editor is extremely popular in the web development community.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
We like this editor because of it's ability to push, pull and merge Github commits and all of the packages/features are great add-ons. You can also change the theme to look like Sublime if that's what you're used to.

### Run

- After downloading the correct version of XAMPP for your computer, open the application.  Under the General tab, click 'Start'.  Once the Status turns green, click on the Services tab and click 'Start All'.  Once all of the stack services turn green, head to the Network tab and click 'Enable'. Then head over to the Volumes tab, click 'Mount' and then 'Explore'.  Once you hit 'Explore', a finder window will pop up. 

- Either download the ZIP file for Grocery Basket or select Open in Desktop, if you have the desktop version of GitHub downloaded, by clicking on the 'clone or download' button.  You will then save the ZIP file under the htdocs folders in the finder.

- Next, using your preferred web browser, launch PHPMyAdmin by navigating to the localhost dashboard at localhost/dashboard (depending on the version of localhost, the port number may need to be specified) and selecting phpMyAdmin. Select the 'SQL' tab. First copy and paste the file 'GroceryBasketDB.rtf', then 'recipeInserts.rtf', 'insertsCont.rtf', 'steps.rtf' and 'tags.rtf'. After this, the database will be fully loaded. 

- Again in your preffered web browser, navigate to Grocery Basket home page by using the url 'http://localhost/GroceryBasket-Web/home.php', again depending on the version of localhost, the port number may need to be specified.  

- Grocery Basket is now up and running. Users are able to sign up/log in, search for recipes, add their own recipes, add a recipe to either favorites or meals and generate a shopping list.
