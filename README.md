# Grocery Basket
## Description
### What?

A web-based application that curates a grocery list based on the recipes you want to make.

### Why?

People'sâ€™ inability to organize their times and fridge leads to further problems. Poor organization can lead to fridges full of unused and spoiled food. This has an obvious financial cost. The price and unpleasantry of throwing out food will discourage people from shopping for ingredients. They will, instead opt to buy frozen unhealthy meals, or spend even more money on takeout.  

Many people do not have time to build a shopping list and go grocery shopping. This lack of time also pushes people to buy fattening frozen meals or spend even more hard-earned money on takeout meals. 

With Grocery Basket, a tool that builds shopping list for users, people can have more freedom, alleviating the symptoms of being a bad planner. A tool like this would improve the users lives by cutting down on food waste and promoting healthier eating. 

### How?

A previously built mobile application in Android Studio will be our inspiration.  We want to develop a web application that curates a shopping list based off their meals. This application will give the user the freedom to favorite meals and add their own meals.  The application will have a responsive design in order to be accessed from any technology, such as phone (Android or iOS), tablet, or computer. This application will help solve the problem of grocery and meal planning, as well as time planning.
