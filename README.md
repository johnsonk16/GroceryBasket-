# Cheffer
## Description
### What?

Cheﬀer is an online mobile and web application that will aid users in ﬁnding and keeping track of recipes and ingredients. It will allow users to search for and save recipes to their account, and they can use it to create an online grocery list, extracting ingredients from recipes. The app can also be used while cooking, by reading the recipe out loud.

### Why?

With Cheﬀer, we aim to assist people who haven’t had much exposure cooking and baking and make it easier for them to organize meals and prepare food, which will hopefully lead to a healthier lifestyle.

### How?

Cheﬀer will purely be a software product that runs on both mobile phones and web application. The app will also be able to store data in a scalable manner. Our team will implement a full-stack application model, with front end and back end. The framework and tools we expect to use are:

Front End
* HTML, LESS (or SASS)/CSS
* JavaScript, React/React Native
* Apollo GraphQL

Back end
* NodeJS, Fastify
* GraphQL, MongoDB

Tools
* Mobile Phone (Android/IOS), Visual Studio Code, Git/GitHub
* Sketch/Invision, Material (or Ant) Design, Heroku/OceanDigital/AWS
