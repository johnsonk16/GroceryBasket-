# Grocery Basket
## Description
### What?

A web-based application that curates a grocery list based on the recipes you want to make.

### Why?

People'sâ€™ inability to organize their times and fridge leads to further problems. Poor organization can lead to fridges full of unused and spoiled food. This has an obvious financial cost. The price and unpleasantry of throwing out food will discourage people from shopping for ingredients. They will, instead opt to buy frozen unhealthy meals, or spend even more money on takeout.  

Many people do not have time to build a shopping list and go grocery shopping. This lack of time also pushes people to buy fattening frozen meals or spend even more hard-earned money on takeout meals. 

With Grocery Basket, a tool that builds shopping list for users, people can have more freedom, alleviating the symptoms of being a bad planner. A tool like this would improve the users lives by cutting down on food waste and promoting healthier eating. 

### How?

A previously built mobile application in Android Studio will be our inspiration.  We want to develop a web application that curates a shopping list based off their meals. This application will give the user the freedom to favorite meals and add their own meals. This application will help solve the problem of grocery and meal planning, as well as time planning.

**Don't have a text editor?**
If you do not have a text editor and would like to view our code on something other than Github, below are two that we recommend!


[Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
This editor is extremely popular in the web development community.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
We like this editor because of it's ability to push, pull and merge Github commits and all of the packages/features are great add-ons. You can also change the theme to look like Sublime if that's what you're used to.

### Run
- After downloading the correct version of xammp for your computer, either download the ZIP file for Grocery Basket or select Open in Desktop, if you have the desktop version of GitHub downloaded, by clicking on the 'clone or download' button.  

- Once downloaded, save the ZIP file under htdocs within your running XAMPP application.  

- Next, using your preffered web browser, launch PHPMyAdmin by navigating to the localhost dashboard at localhost/dashboard (depending on the version of localhost, the port number may need to be specified) and selecting phpMyAdmin. Select the 'SQL' tab. First copy and paste the file 'GroceryBasketDB.rtf', then 'recipeInserts.rtf', 'insertsCont.rtf', 'steps.rtf' and 'tags.rtf'. After this, the database will be fully loaded. 

- Again in your preffered web browser, navigate to Grocery Basket home page by using the url 'http://localhost/GroceryBasket-Web/home.php', again depending on the version of localhost, the port number may need to be specified.  

- Grocery Basket is now up and running. Users are able to sign up/log in, search for recipes, add their own recipes, add a recipe to either favorites or meals and generate a shopping list.
